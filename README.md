# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning

In this project focused on house price prediction in Maharashtra, you utilize a combination of machine learning models—Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Lasso Regression—to predict housing prices based on various factors such as area, number of bedrooms, and location. This approach allows you to assess and compare the effectiveness of different algorithms in tackling real-world problems within the real estate market.

<h4>Project Overview : </h4><br>
The goal of your project is to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately determine the market price of houses in Maharashtra based on a selected set of features. Maharashtra, being one of the most economically significant states in India, has a diverse and dynamic real estate market that varies greatly from urban centers like Mumbai and Pune to rural areas. Therefore, the dataset you use is likely rich with various inputs that influence housing prices, such as geographical location, total living area, and the number of bedrooms.

<h4>Data Collection and Preprocessing : </h4> <br> 
The initial stage involves collecting and preparing the Maharashtra dataset, which presumably includes data points from multiple cities within the state. Key features include:<br>
- Area: The square footage of the property.<br>           
- Number of Bedrooms: A critical feature that affects price.<br> 
- Location: This could include both the city and more localized information such as neighborhoods.
