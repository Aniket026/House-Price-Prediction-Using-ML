# House-Price-Prediction-Using-ML


In the house price prediction project, machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Lasso Regression are used. Decision Trees model non-linear relationships through branches. Linear Regression predicts prices by fitting a line to numeric data. Lasso Regression, a type of Linear Regression, includes regularization to enhance prediction accuracy by reducing overfitting.
